  Dr.Gary Geisler (Univ Texas at Austin, school of information) is the PI for the entire project.

  functionality:
  Scene change detection, meta image/movie files generation
  This tool has dependencies to ffmpeg and gd libraries

  release:
   Oct 2008 -primary plan
   Apr 2009 -postponed
   Dec 2009 -grant deadline

  - beta 1.0: using systemwide-install of gd and ffmpeg

  todo:

  - mediaConfig.large is not used. veryfy and delete it

  - need a bit more fine tuning on auto-config of skip frames
      driven from fps which I do not get right number
  - create confirmation html in parse directory to show resulting files
  - reorganize and rewrite entire code for open source
  - implement overflow prevention

  - logic for src frame buffer size prediction

  - find out if different still format will affect fast forward quality
  - normalize and crop the hist for better sc_detect
  - gui
  - fix sliding color of output mov.
  - scene change:
  		block of 8x8 or so, pattern match sliding neighbors if histogram is close enough
  - eliminate scene detected frame of initial black screen
